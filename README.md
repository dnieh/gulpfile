# gulpfile

For access anywhere and getting new projects up and running faster. I found myself re-writing the same basic gulpfile,
so I might as well keep some basic version in my github profile.

Commonly used front end automation tasks:
* Gulp
* Browserify JS
* Building Sass
* Transforming JSX
* Transforming ES6

TODO:
* JS Lint
* Sass Lint
