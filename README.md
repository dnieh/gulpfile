# gulpfile

For access anywhere and getting new projects up and running faster. I found myself re-writing the same basic gulpfile,
so I might as well keep some basic version in my github profile.

Commonly used front-end automation tasks:
* Sass to CSS
* Writing Node JS modules that get built into client side JS
* Transpiling ES6 JS
* Transpiling React JS(X)
* Linting
* Minifying
* Watching
