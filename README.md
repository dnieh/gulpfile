# gulpfile

I found myself re-writing the same basic gulpfile. For access anywhere and getting new projects up and running faster.

Commonly used front-end automation tasks:
* Sass to CSS
* Writing Node JS modules that get built into client side JS
* Transpiling ES6 JS
* Transpiling React JS(X)
* Linting
* Minifying
* Watching
* Testing
